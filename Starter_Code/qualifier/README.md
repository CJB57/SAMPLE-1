# Loan Qualifier Application

We are creating a CLI application using Python, to determine whether a user qualifies for loans from lenders. By importing a CSV provided from the lenders, we can use the CLI to collect input that will determine the user's eligibility to qualify for selected loans, and will then produce a list of all loans qualified for.
